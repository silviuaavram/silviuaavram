_There's also a Starbies on the promenade, perfect to sip on a Cold Brew while
watching surfers just getting destroyed by the waves. Oh, bliss._

Sicily deserved a part 2 after the
[Catania trip](https://silviuaavram.com/catania-2023), and Palermo was the
natural next stop. It's also conveniently situated near the beach, as well as
the nearby town of Cefalu, which was also on the trip list. We were so ready for
a few days of Dolce Vita, andare in spiaggia, mangiare i cannoli and enjoying
some ancient history combined with great scenery.

## Palermo Food

Not going to sugar-coat it: Sicily is the perfect place to fall in love with
life. Palermo is simply pure romance, and has so much to offer. We were lucky to
have booked an airbnb right next to the Vila Maqueda, _the place to be_. Every
restaurant and eating place was at most 5 minutes away, and, as you probably
imagine, we took advantage. If you are keeping a strict diet, avoid this place
like the plague. Otherwise, well, brace yourselves. We did not eat cannoli that
much until we got to Sicily, purely because there was nothing special about them
in any other place. Here though, totally different story, as they were just so
good, the cream was perfectly textured, the flavour just right, and the crunch
exactly like in the commercials. Cannoli&Co for reference, you're welcome.

Also here we discovered something else that we did not eat before just because
when we tried they were meh. Star number two: arancini. Balls of fried rice with
mozzarella and proscitto? Yes, please, keep them coming. Other culinary stars
were here as well, here in Hollyfood:

- gelato that is always welcome in any moment of the day.
- pizza that's handmade.
- aperol spritz to keep the vacation mood going.

These are always the super stars of Italy and Palermo did not come short in
delivering them. Oh, to make sure I won't forget. There's another Sicilian star
here, something I did not have before, and which proved to be worthy of
admiration: the Sicilian gelato brioche. A. Ma. Zing.

I'll stop. I'm Hungry.
