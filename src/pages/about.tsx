                  Hi, I'm Silviu, and I'm a software engineer üë®‚Äçüíª. When I'm not
                  coding, I spend my time playing basketball üèÄ, salsa dancing
                  üï∫ and drinking cofee ‚òïÔ∏è. I also drink coffee when coding, so
                  there's that.

                <p>
                  I believe that writing is an important way to improve myself
                  and others. If I write about a particular subject, without
                  someone explicitly forcing me to do it, it means that I aim to
                  understand that subject well enough. And I consider it
                  important enough to share it with someone else. It's the
                  reason why I built this blog, to thing and write about stuff
                  that is helpful to me and can also be helpful to others.

                  I attended the <i>B.P. Hasdeu High School</i> in Buzau,
                  finishing the class of Mathematics and Informatics, with a
                  special focus on English. I confess that I was not a huge fan
                  of the first two at that time. Consequently, my choice of
                  college was a lucky one, as it turned out in the future. The
                  choice was the{' '}
                  <i>
                    Authomatics and Computers Faculty of the Politechnic
                    University of Bucharest.
                  </i>{' '}
                  Even though I found programming and engineering smart and
                  interesting at that time, I as not very sure about everything,
                  since I failed to find much meaning into it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The meaning of programming and computer science came one
                  beautiful spring day in 2013. I was accepted at{' '}
                  <i>BitDefender</i> for the internship position of Quality
                  Assurance Analyst. It was one of the best moment of my life,
                  as people in a company actually needed me to work for them.
                  And they paid. And they had free coffee. During that amazin
                  summer I discovered my passion for automation, as I developed
                  a Java and Batch based script that tested file transfer
                  between a couple of Android devices, using the application we
                  were supposed to test. They proposed I should stay employed
                  after the internship was over, but sadly I had to refuse since
                  third year of college was rumored to be the most demanding of
                  all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2014 I was accepted for another internship at{' '}
                  <i>Renault Technologie Roumanie</i>, which was not exactly
                  what I expected to be. Even so, I did developed a Java Swing
                  based application that helped the team check some calibration
                  files they used for testing. Was even rewarded a toy car for
                  the app, but sadly I had to give it away after a few weeks üò¢.

                  My first full time job was at Adobe in 2014 as a Junior
                  Software Engineer in Test. My interest for automation led me
                  to improve
                  <i>Business Catalyst's</i> end-to-end automated testing
                  framework. My best achievement for that project was updating
                  the framework to run the automated tests in parallel, using a
                  Selenium Grid infrastructure. After Business Catalyst, I
                  became a Software Developer in Test for{' '}
                  <i>Adobe Experience Design</i>, where I helped the team create
                  an automated testing solution from the ground up. There I
                  discovered JavaScript and I honestly fell in love with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The testing framework became so important that I was asked to
                  travel to Bangalore and ramp up a whole engineering team to
                  write more automated tests for Adobe XD. The experience
                  thought me that I enjoy teaching others about the things I'm
                  passionate about, and sharing knowledge within teams is the
                  key to delivering great results.

                  During my automated testing experience, I realised that I
                  enjoyed coding more than testing. Consequently, I applied for
                  a Software Developer position and received the opportunity to
                  work at Microsoft in the summer of 2017, on one of it's most
                  important products, <i>Microsoft Teams</i>. It also involved a
                  relocation to Prague, which made the challenge even more
                  daunting. After working on the Teams AngularJS client for a
                  year, I switched gears to FluentUI (formerly known as
                  Stardust), and started to build ReactJS components in
                  TypeScript, with automated testing and accessibility in mind.
                  Joined by a couple of colleagues, I delivered a demo at{' '}
                  <Link href="https://www.csun.edu/cod/conference">
                    CSUN 2019
                  </Link>{' '}
                  about Teams' Callings and Meetings functionality, along with
                  its accessibility features and support. While working on
                  Fluent I also came into contact with the Downshift npm library
                  and its creator,{' '}
                  <Link href="https://kentcdodds.com/">Kent C Dodds</Link>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I came back to Bucharest in the infamous year of 2020, and
                  joined Adobe again, this time as a FrontEnd Developer for
                  Adobe Target. I had the opportunity to apply what I learned in
                  terms of accessibility, automated desting and design systems.
                  During that time I had the incredible opportunity to be a
                  speaker at{' '}
                  <Link href="https://www.deque.com/axe-con/">
                    Deque's axe-con
                  </Link>{' '}
                  in 2021, where I presented Downshift's hooks API.

            <p>
              During my tenure at Microsoft, when building the <i>Dropdown</i>{' '}
              component for the Stardust component library, someone suggested we
              could use{' '}
              <Link href="https://www.downshift-js.com/">downshift üèé</Link> to
              build it in an accessible way. After using it and creating a few
              of pull requests with improvements for the library, Kent C Dodds,
              the library creator, asked me to maintain it. It was a huge
              challenge since I never in my life maintained an npm library, and
              Downshift was huge by size. I strongly believe that maintaining
              this library and Kent's trust changed my life, and I will be
              forever grateful for the opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since I started to maintain Downshift, ot received a new updated
              docsite based on{' '}
              <Link href="https://docusaurus.io/">docusaurus</Link>, which is,
              incidentally, the same library I used to build this blog with. It
              also offeres a new ARIA 1.2 compatible API based on React hooks
              for select, combobox and taglist components. The hooks API was
              showcased live at axe-con 2021, which was the first conferance I
              was a speaker by myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from Downshift, I also had some contributions to other open
              source projects that were related to my work, such as CypressIO
              and Testing Library.
